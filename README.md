# gameengine

A first attempt at creating a 2D game engine with c++.

### Features of the Engine

- Sprite Creation
- Collision Detection
- Event System
- Debugging Tools
- Rendering System - Using SDL
- Resource Management:
  - Develop a resource management system to handle loading and unloading of game assets, such as sprites, textures, and sounds. This could include a basic asset pipeline.
- Physics Simulation:
  - If your game requires physics, consider implementing a basic physics simulation system. This might include handling forces, collisions, and basic rigid body dynamics.
